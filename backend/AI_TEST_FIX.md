# AI Integration Test Fix

## Problem
The original `test_ai_integration.py` was causing timeouts because it was making actual API calls to OpenAI/Ollama services, which could hang if:
- API keys weren't configured
- Services weren't running
- Network issues occurred

## Solution
Created `test_ai_integration_simple.py` that tests the AI integration components without making actual API calls:

### Tests Included:
1. **AI Providers Import** - Tests that LLM providers can be imported
2. **Configuration Loading** - Tests that LLM configuration loads correctly
3. **Database Connection** - Tests database connectivity
4. **FastAPI Import** - Tests that the main app can be imported
5. **Environment Variables** - Tests environment variable handling

### Benefits:
- ✅ Fast execution (no API calls)
- ✅ No external dependencies
- ✅ Tests core functionality
- ✅ Reliable results

### Original Test Status:
The original `test_ai_integration.py` is still available for manual testing when you want to test actual API integration with live services.

## Usage:
```bash
# Fast component testing (recommended for CI/CD)
python test_ai_integration_simple.py

# Full API integration testing (manual testing)
python test_ai_integration.py
```

This fix ensures the test suite completes quickly and reliably while still validating the core AI integration components.
